Currently under development. Way too early to provide any releases.

## About
Office Manager was designed for Civil Air Patrol's Mount Vernon Composite Squadron in the National Capital Wing, but may be used for other squadrons if desired. Office Manager helps office staff keep track of supply and which cadets or senior members have taken certain items. It also can show which cadets and flights are doing well with inspections.
